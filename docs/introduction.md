# Introduction

## Overview

Asset Intelligence is an application that aims to help customers improve the availability and reliability of their critical assets by actively monitoring the Health and Performance of those assets and notifying key stakeholders when action is needed to prevent planned and unplanned downtime.

Asset Intelligence is a Rockwell Automation Software-as-a-Service offering. It is accessible through the FactoryTalk Hub, and the Data Operations platform is FactoryTalk DataMosaix. All data that is needed as input for Health and Performance is available in FactoryTalk DataMosaix, where it can be easily consumed by Asset Intelligence.

Starting with the Mining Industry, pre-built Asset Model templates are available for Conveyors, Ball Mills, and Pump Asset Classes. These templates will provide users with value out of the box. Users can build out the hierarchy as required, applying Asset Model Templates to created Assets to shorten the time to value. The pre-defined KPIs and the ability to define your own equations are provided to expand and scale the solution further.

This user manual provides the information about how to use the application, configure, and interact with Asset Intelligence. It is divided into three sections:

1. Dashboards
2. Configuration
3. Tools

Additional references are also provided where applicable for interacting with other applications to ensure that the user can be successful with Asset Intelligence.

## Features

1. **Asset Intelligence Dashboards**: It helps the user to visualize the KPI health, get the top 5 underperforming asset at all levels, and access the triggered alerts at each node.
2. **Asset Setup**: It helps the user to create an asset hierarchy structure, configure sensors and KPIs at the asset and component level.
3. **Function Setup**: It helps the user to create custom equations and view the available KPI and ML functions.
4. **Notification Setup**: It helps the user to configure notification for an asset or asset group.
5. **Dashboard Setup**: It helps the user to configure default KPIs to be displayed on the cards throughout the application.
6. **Asset Model Setup**: It helps the user to preview, import, and export asset model templates.
7. **User Management**: It helps the user to create roles, manage user access and resources such as asset class and Sites.
8. **User Settings**: It helps the user to configure language settings.
9. **Modifying** the Hierarchy: It helps the user to modify the hierarchy structure by moving the hierarchy node.
10. **Favorites**: It helps the user to have a list of nodes added to favorites for easy access or navigation.
11. **Compare**: It helps the user to compare assets within an asset class and analyze their common and uncommon KPI Health and their component's risk score. The user can also convert unit of measure in the common asset KPI section.
12. **Underperforming Assets**: It helps the user to analyze the top 5,10,20,100 underperforming assets across any level in the hierarchy considering their common KPIs.
13. **Trending**: It helps the user to visualize the Sensors or KPI's health and get useful insights from their data.
14. **Alerts**: It helps the user to navigate to the global alerts page with list of KPI alerts and Sensor fault alerts across all the levels in the hierarchy.
